# World Flag Clicky-Game

## Flags from different countries are one the screen, try not to click the same image twice!

### The application keeps track of the user's score. 

### The user's score increments when clicking an image for the first time. 

### The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

### Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.

### Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
